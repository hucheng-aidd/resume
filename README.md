Manage and coach medicinal chemistry/project team members;
Lead the development and implementation of machine learning models to enable faster delivery of hit2lead and lead optimization project goals;
Lead the evaluation, selection and implementation of computational tools to expedite compound design/make/test/analysis (DMTA) cycle;

Delivered best-in-class systemic and first-in-class gut-restricted RIPK2 advanced candidates for IBD
Launched the design and synthesis of two hit to lead projects (undisclosed oncology/immunology targets)
Led multiple AI enabled HitID, HitExpansion, Hit2Lead and LeadOptimization drug discovery projects;
Contributed to the identification and prioritization of projects to build a portfolio of drug discovery projects.

Represented medicinal chemistry/DMPK on the weekly AIDD model and workflow development meetings
Advised development and implementation of ADMETwise for internal and collaborative drug discovery projects
Led the integration of ADMETwise and Structure-based pKi prediction into the automatic molecule design/synthesis/test/analysis workflow
Built the practical use cases of AI application in drug discovery process for BD purposes
